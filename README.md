PROJECT OVERVIEW :

This project is an Automated Report Generation System developed using Python. The main objective of this project is to automatically generate a professional report from a dataset without manual calculations. The system reads sales data from a CSV file, performs analysis such as total sales, total target, best performing product, and achievement percentage, and then generates a well-formatted PDF report.

2.The Python program reads the dataset using Pandas.
3.It calculates important statistics like -Total Sales,Total Target,Highest Sales Product,Sales Achievement Percentage
4.A bar chart is generated using Matplotlib.
5..Finally, a detailed PDF report is created using ReportLab, including summary, table data, and chart.

TECHNOLOGIES USED :

1.This project uses the following technologies

2.Python (Main programming language)

3.Pandas (For reading and analyzing CSV data)

4.Matplotlib (For generating bar chart visualization)

5.ReportLab (For creating the PDF report)
